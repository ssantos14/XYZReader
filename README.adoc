This repository contains my submission for the fourth project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree program. Below are the instructions provided to students.

Project Overview:
In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

-Understand the fundamentals of Android design

-Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application

-Separate an interface into surfaces

-Effectively use transitions and motion

How Will I Complete this Project?
You will improve an app for this project:

XYZ Reader: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.
